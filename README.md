# ProcessScheduler
Developing a basic process scheduler that receives a file containing sample processes and generates a schedule according to one of the three schedule types:
First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS), 
Shortest-Job-First (SJF) preemptive
SJF Priority (always preemptive)
Round-robin (RR). 

Every process is CPU-bound; they don't block for input or output (I/O). 
Programming language to write the scheduler = 'Go'.
