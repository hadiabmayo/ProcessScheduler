# ProcessScheduler
building a simple process scheduler that takes in a file containing example processes, and outputs a schedule based on the three different schedule types:      FCFS, Shortest-Job-First (SJF) preemptive,   SJF Priority (always preemptive), Round-robin (RR). all processes are CPU bound (they do not block for I/O).  The scheduler will be written in Go
